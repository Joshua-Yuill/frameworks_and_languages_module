Server Framework Features
-------------------------

### (Automatic Data Validation)

(A feature of using FastAPI as my framework for my server is automatic data validation. If incorrect data is entered it is dealt with automatically and an appropriate error is thrown without affecting the functionality of the program)

Critique of Server/Client prototype
---------------------

### HTTP Response codes are incomplete

```javascript
RESPONSE_CODES = {
    200: 'OK',
    201: 'Created',
    204: 'No Content',
    301: 'Moved Permanently',
    304: 'Not Modified',
    400: 'Bad Request',
    401: 'Unauthorized',
    403: 'Forbidden',
    404: 'Not Found',
    405: 'Method Not Allowed',
    500: 'Internal Server Error',
    501: 'Not Implemented',
}
```
This code block does not follow the specification of response codes used by HTTP. This is an issue as the program will be unable to handle some responses appropriately. There could be edge-cases, while being very unlikely to happen, they are not improbable and such an incorrect HTTP code will be delivered to the user.
